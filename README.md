# Gender_-_Age_predicxtion
This project uses Python, OpenCV, and Deep Learning models to predict the gender and age group of a person from an image. The model is based on pretrained Caffe networks that analyze facial features and output predictions, even under variations in lighting, cosmetics, or facial expressions.
